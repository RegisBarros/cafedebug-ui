## Discovery Decision Log

| Type | Decision or fact | Evidence / rationale | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Known | Contact is a non-fast-path Visual web page at `/contact`. | User brief and workflow classification. | Architect Guardian |
| Known | Contact has no route or feature implementation. | Repository discovery. | Architect Guardian |
| Known | `(beta)/layout.tsx` composes `Header variant="beta"` and `Footer variant="beta"`; user explicitly requires those variants. | Repository source and user clarification. | Architect Guardian |
| Known | Shared navigation already exposes `Debuggers → /debuggers`. | `navigation-items.ts`. | Architect Guardian |
| Known | Existing NewsletterForm is UI-only and prevents default submission. | `features/episodes/components/newsletter-form.tsx`. | Architect Guardian |
| Inferred | `features/contact` is the correct domain; route logic stays in `(beta)/contact`. | Existing feature architecture and Beta route convention. | Architect Guardian |
| Inferred | Footer `Contato` should become one canonical `/contact` shared destination when route ships. | Existing deferred Footer link plus request route. | Architect Guardian |
| Known | Nome, Email, Assunto, and Mensagem are required. Subject options/default are the user-supplied deterministic list in `spec.md`. | User decision on 2026-08-16. | Product owner |
| Known | Valid contact submission uses a deterministic local mock service, no network request, resets fields/default, and announces `Mensagem enviada com sucesso.` | User decision on 2026-08-16. | Product owner |
| Known | Discord and social behavior is external. All destinations use clearly non-production `example.com/cafedebug/<platform>` fixture URLs until production configuration exists. | User approved mock URL behavior on 2026-08-16. | Product owner |
| Known | The Discord CTA retains its 12px-gapped `ArrowUpRight`; its badge follows the business-card secondary rounded-square/primary-icon pattern and its online presence indicator is success-colored. | User clarification and dark/light Pen update on 2026-08-16. | Product owner |
| Known | Contact newsletter inherits the existing UI-only, prevent-default/no-network submission responsibility; the Contact layout can be a compatible composition, not a second state owner. | Existing NewsletterForm plus scanned Pencil copy/geometry. | Build |
| Known | Direct desktop Pencil inspection completed for `hBoyk`/`Glg7r`: hierarchy, screenshots, visible copy, desktop measurements, and core light/dark surfaces are recorded in `design.md`. | Pencil MCP connected on 2026-08-16. | Pencil / Build |
| Inferred | Tablet/mobile stacks the 460px contact sidebar below form and reflows cards/controls without overflow. | Existing foundation responsiveness contract explicitly covers the contact split. | Build |
| Blocked evidence | Default desktop frames do not show required/error/loading/success/disabled form states. | Do not invent or label them Pencil-confirmed. | Pencil / Product owner |

## Acceptance Traceability

| Acceptance ID | Phase | Evidence (path, command, or URL) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-01 | Validation | thin route/Footer source test and six browser matrix checks | pass |
| AC-02 | Evidence | direct Pencil `hBoyk`/`Glg7r` hierarchy/screenshots plus `validation.md` comparison | pass |
| AC-03 | Validation | browser semantic snapshot and Pencil/browser section comparison | pass |
| AC-04 | Validation | all-required/error IDs, mock submit/reset/live status browser evidence | pass |
| AC-05 | Validation | source fixture test and external-link attribute browser evidence | pass |
| AC-06 | Validation | reused UI-only newsletter owner source test | pass |
| AC-07 | Validation | six viewport/theme browser checks plus product-owner-confirmed literal 200% zoom observation | pass |
| AC-08 | Visual review | Resolved Pencil/browser comparison, user-confirmed 200% zoom, and 86-test validation | pass |

## Handoff Record

| Phase | Owner | Inputs | Outputs / changed paths | Selected skills | Risks / blockers | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery | Architect Guardian / Build | brief, repository, live `cafedebug.pen` | Desktop scan recorded in `design.md` | `spec`, `draft-tech-spec` | Live mobile artboards absent; inherited reflow constraint recorded | implementation-ready mock scope |
| Specify/design/plan | Spec Writer / Master Planner | discovery handoff, Pencil scan, product decisions | `spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, this file, index entry | `spec`, `draft-tech-spec`; `web-design-reviewer` before `webapp-testing` | Mock-only scope; real destinations/API deferred | approved for implementation |
| Implementation | Frontend Blacksmith | approved Contact package and direct desktop Pencil contract | `apps/web/src/app/(beta)/contact/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/features/contact/**`, `apps/web/src/components/layout/footer.tsx`, `apps/web/src/features/episodes/components/newsletter-form.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/ui/input.tsx`, dependencies and focused tests | `build`, `context7-mcp`, `web-design-reviewer` baseline | browser/Pencil re-comparison and interaction validation remain | ready for visual review |
| Visual correction review | Build / web-design-reviewer | user screenshots, active Pencil `hBoyk`/`Glg7r` and descendants, live local browser | resolved correction record in `validation.md`; Contact, InputGroup, fixture and test updates | `web-design-reviewer`, `webapp-testing` | No remaining visual blocker; product owner completed the 200% zoom observation | approved by Debugger and Documentation Monk |

## Validation Evidence

| Check | Command or review | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | feature source/test review | pass | The route remains metadata/composition-only; no `fetch`, API, persistence, `server`, or `services` layer was added. |
| Visual source | Pencil MCP screenshots plus browser comparison | pass | Resolved social, Discord, business, typography, and icon treatment parity are recorded in `validation.md`. |
| Behavior | `pnpm --filter @cafedebug/web run test` | pass | 86/86 tests, including focused Contact route, fixture, mock-submit, newsletter, and link checks. |
| Lint | `pnpm --filter @cafedebug/web run lint` | pass | No ESLint findings. |
| Typecheck | `pnpm --filter @cafedebug/web run typecheck` | pass | TypeScript completed with no errors. |
| Build | `pnpm --filter @cafedebug/web run build` | pass | Next build completed and listed `/contact`. |
| Diff integrity | `git diff --check` | pass | No whitespace errors. |
| Browser | browser form, link, compact-nav, viewport matrix, and 200% zoom | pass | User confirmed the literal 200% zoom review on 2026-08-16; no clipping or overflow was reported. |
| Documentation impact | `.specs/README.md`, `validation.md` | pass | Index and evidence package are current. |

## Final Gate

- [x] Acceptance criteria traced to evidence
- [x] Required skills selected and recorded
- [x] Architecture boundaries recorded
