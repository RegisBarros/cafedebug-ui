# Specs Directory

This repository follows **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** for all non-trivial work.

Specs ensure humans, Copilot, and AI agents stay aligned before implementation begins.

---

## Spec-Driven Workflow

All features must follow this lifecycle:
Specify → Design → Tasks → Execute

### 1. spec.md (Specify)

Defines the **problem and expected behavior**.

Focus:

- what we are building
- why it matters
- user and business context

---

### 2. design.md (Design)

Defines the **solution and architecture**.

Focus:

- UI structure and layout
- component composition
- API contracts
- data flow
- state management

---

### 3. tasks.md (Tasks)

Defines the **implementation plan**.

Focus:

- step-by-step tasks
- safe execution order
- validation steps
- dependencies between tasks

---

### 4. Execute

Implementation must follow:

- the spec
- the design
- the task breakdown

---
